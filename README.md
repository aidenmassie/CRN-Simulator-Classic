# Chemical Reaction Network Simulator
A command-line interface program to simulate chemical reaction networks. Chemical Reaction Networks are a model of chemistry designed to abstract chemical reactions as species that react with each other to create new species from a set of reactions. In this program, users can create their own chemical reaction networks with species and rulesets of their choice. They can then run their system over a chosen configuration and observe any applicable changes to it (if possible). A notable option for this program is the implementation of the Step Chemical Reaction Network, a recent proposed augmentation to the original CRN in which additional species may be introduced into the system once a terminal configuration is reached.

## How to Run
Run the command python3 crn_cmd.py
